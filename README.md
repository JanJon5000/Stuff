# Stuff
This repo was originally my idea to store small and insignificant to my future career and education files which I wanted to show of on github.

When I am writing this (20.04.2025) I came back to bring fresh air to it and kind of give it a new purpose. New-old purpose to be exact - it will act as a big basket with console/window aplications I made for <strong>some actual purpose</strong> and not only to "understand if statement in dart".

That was it for the intro, now lets explore the files:

## Podstawy_programowania
<strong style="color:green;">COMPLETED</strong>
    <p>Its a project I made to pass a class at my university. Its a console application whose main attractive feature was colors of diffrent parts of text on the screen. It wasnt complex or fun - it taught me a little about manipulating text in console with C++, but what kind of quality in todays programming enviroment is it?</p>

## Algorithms
<strong style="color:green;">WILL DEFFINITELLY DO MORE IN THE FUTURE</strong>
    <p>Some algorithms I tried too understand bycoding them in Python or C++ - mainly sorting ones and some ciphers as well</p>

## C++ Playground
<strong style="color:yellow;">A MESS - SOMEWHAT COMPLETED, SOMEWHAT DISCONTINUED, SOMEWHAT DK</strong>
    <p>Some console apps I made with C++ 
    - casino simulator (not really but somewhat accurate name)
    - Language Manipulator in which you can make strings such as RERERERERERERE with commands and when lazy
    - Math - which was an attempt to make non-decimal fractions and mathematical vectors</p>

## Antenna
<strong>NOT FINISHED YET</strong>
    <p>Matlab script I created to draw standarized antenna radiation graphs - for purpose of my education, passing the class and as an excuse to learn some Matlab (Excel cant do these)</p>
